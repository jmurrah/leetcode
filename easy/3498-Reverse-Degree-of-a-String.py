"""
Given a string s, calculate its reverse degree.

The reverse degree is calculated as follows:

    For each character, multiply its position in the reversed alphabet ('a' = 26, 'b' = 25, ..., 'z' = 1) with its position in the string (1-indexed).
    Sum these products for all characters in the string.

Return the reverse degree of s.
